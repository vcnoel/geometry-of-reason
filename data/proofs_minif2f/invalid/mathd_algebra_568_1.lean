  (a : ℝ) :
  (a - 1) * (a + 1) * (a + 2) - (a - 2) * (a + 1) = a^3 + a^2 :=
begin

  -- Expand both sides of the equation
  ring_nf,
  -- The left-hand side of the equation
  -- Simplify the left-hand side of the equation
  -- The right-hand side of the equation
  -- The equation is now in the form: a^3 + a^2 = a^3 + a^2
  -- The equation is an equality
