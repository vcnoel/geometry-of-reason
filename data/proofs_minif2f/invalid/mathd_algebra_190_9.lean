  -- Step 1: Simplify the left-hand side of the equation
  -- We can start by simplifying the expression on the left-hand side of the equation.
  -- The expression is ((3 : ℝ) / 8 + 7 / 8) / (4 / 5).
  -- To simplify this expression, we can start by adding the fractions 3/8 and 7/8.
  -- The result of adding these fractions is (3 + 7) / 8 = 10 / 8.
  -- So the expression becomes (10 / 8) / (4 / 5).
  
  -- Step 2: Simplify the expression further
  -- Now we can simplify the expression (10 / 8) / (4 / 5) further.
  -- To do this, we can multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction 10/8 by 5.
  -- This gives us (10 * 5) / (8 * 5) = 50 / 40.
  -- So the expression becomes 50 / 40.
  
  -- Step 3: Simplify the expression even further
  -- Now we can simplify the expression 50 / 40 further.
