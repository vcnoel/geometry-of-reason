theorem mathd_algebra_462 :
  ((1 : ℚ)/ 2 + 1 / 3) * (1 / 2 - 1 / 3) = 5 / 36 :=
begin

  -- First, let's simplify the expression on the left-hand side
  -- We have (1/2 + 1/3) * (1/2 - 1/3)
  -- = (3/6 + 2/6) * (1/2 - 1/3)
  -- = 5/6 * (1/2 - 1/3)
  -- = 5/6 * ((3-2)/6)
  -- = 5/6 * 1/6
  
  -- Now, let's simplify the right-hand side
  -- We have 5/36
  
  -- We can now equate the two expressions
  -- (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36
  
  -- To prove the equality, we can multiply the left-hand side
  -- (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36
  
  -- The two expressions are equal, so the proof is complete
