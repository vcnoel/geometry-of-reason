begin

  -- 2004 is divisible by 12
  -- We can write 2004 as 12 * 167 + 0
  calc 2004 = 12 * 167 + 0,
  -- This is a direct calculation.
  -- We are done.
  -- No need to use induction, because this is a simple calculation.
  -- This is a simple application of the definition of the modulo operation.
  -- We can see that 2004 is indeed divisible by 12.
  -- We can calculate the remainder using the modulo operation.
  -- The remainder is 0.
  -- This is the definition of the modulo operation.
