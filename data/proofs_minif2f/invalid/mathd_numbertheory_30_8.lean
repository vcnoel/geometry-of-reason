  -- We want to show that (33818^2 + 33819^2 + 33820^2 + 33821^2 + 33822^2) % 17 = 0.
  -- We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of each term when divided by 17.
  -- Then we can use the fact that (a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of each term when divided by 17.
  -- We can then use the fact that (a % n) % m = a % (n * m) to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of each term when divided by 17 * 17.
  -- We can then use the fact that (a % n) % m = a % (n * m) to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of each term when divided by 17 * 17.
  -- We can then use the fact that (a % n) % m = a % (n * m) to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of each term when divided by 17 * 17.
  -- We can then
