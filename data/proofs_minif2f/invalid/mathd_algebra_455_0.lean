  -- Now, we have 2 * (2 * (2 * (2 * x))) = 48.
  -- We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
  -- First, we have 2 * (2 * (2 * x)) = 16 * x.
  -- Then, we have 2 * (16 * x) = 32 * x.

  -- Now, we have 32 * x = 48.
  -- We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 32.
  -- This gives us x = 48 / 32.

  -- We can simplify the fraction 48 / 32 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
  -- The greatest common divisor of 48 and 32 is 16.
  -- So, we have x = (48 / 16) / (32 / 16).

  -- Now, we have x = 3 / 2.

  -- But we are given that x = 3.
  -- So, we have 3 / 2 = 3.

  -- This is clearly false, since 3 / 2 ≠
