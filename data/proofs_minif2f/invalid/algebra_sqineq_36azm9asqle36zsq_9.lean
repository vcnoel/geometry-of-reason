  -- The goal is to prove that 36 * (a * z) - 9 * a^2 ≤ 36 * z^2.
  -- First, let's expand the left-hand side using the distributive law.
  -- This gives us 36 * a * z - 9 * a^2.
  -- Now, let's rewrite the right-hand side as 36 * z^2.
  -- The goal is now to prove that 36 * a * z - 9 * a^2 ≤ 36 * z^2.
  -- We can start by moving all terms to the left-hand side of the inequality.
  -- This gives us 36 * a * z - 36 * z^2 - 9 * a^2 ≤ 0.
  -- Now, let's factor out a common factor of 9 from the left-hand side.
  -- This gives us 9 * (4 * a * z - 4 * z^2 - a^2) ≤ 0.
  -- Now, let's factor out a common factor of 4 from the first two terms.
  -- This gives us 9 * (4 * z * (a - z) - a^2)
